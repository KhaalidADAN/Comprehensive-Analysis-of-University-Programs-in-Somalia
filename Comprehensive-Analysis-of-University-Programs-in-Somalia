# Comprehensive Analysis of University Programs in Somalia

## Project Overview
This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis of university programs in Somalia, focusing on two key aspects: **Program Duration** and **Tuition Fees**. By examining data across different faculties and universities, we uncover important trends and insights that can inform strategic decisions for both institutions and students.

## Business Understanding
Understanding the dynamics of program duration and tuition fees is critical for universities in Somalia to align their offerings with market demand. This analysis aims to equip stakeholders with actionable insights to enhance program structures and financial strategies.

**Stakeholders:**
- University Administrators
- Students and Prospective Students
- Educational Policy Makers

## Data Understanding
The dataset encompasses various factors, including:
- Number of programs by faculty
- Distribution of program duration
- Tuition fee ranges
- Comparison of mean program durations across universities

### Key Insights:
1. **Number of Programs by Faculty:**
   - The Faculty of Economics and Management and the Faculty of Engineering and ICT offer the largest number of programs, indicating high demand in these fields.
  
2. **Distribution of Program Duration:**
   - Most programs last **4 years**, with some extending to **5 or 6 years**, reflecting common educational structures.

3. **Distribution of Tuition Fees:**
   - The majority of tuition fees range between **$1500 and $3450**, with some outliers charging significantly higher fees up to **$18900**.

4. **Tuition Fees by Program Duration:**
   - Longer programs tend to have higher tuition fees, suggesting a correlation between program length and cost.

5. **Comparison of Mean Program Duration Across Universities:**
   - SIMAD University offers the longest programs on average, exceeding **7 years**.

## Data Limitations
- The analysis may not represent the full spectrum of universities in Somalia, and more granular data is needed to capture the complete picture of student needs and institutional performance.

## Conclusion
This analysis highlights key trends in both program duration and tuition fees across universities in Somalia. The findings suggest:
- High demand for Economics, Business, and ICT programs.
- A positive correlation exists between program length and tuition costs, which could guide universities in structuring their offerings effectively.

## Next Steps
- **Data Enrichment:** Collect more detailed data to better understand factors influencing program success and student enrollment.
- **Program Development:** Encourage universities to innovate within less represented fields while expanding popular programs.
- **Policy Recommendations:** Provide insights to educational policy makers for strategic planning in higher education.
